# Spotify BPM Playlist Generator - Spotigo!

Spotigo Is an all-in-one solution for discovering and creating playlists based off of BPM.
The core functionality of the site is the playlist generator. It takes in a BPM and automatically
generates a playlist consisting of songs near the given BPM. 
- This would be a useful tool for quickly creating and sharing workout playlists, tailored to your likes and interests.
- Users can share generated playlists, and the site will curate these playlists and allow users to search through the playlist database.
- Users can log in to have their feed and recommendations personalized.
