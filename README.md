# Spotify BPM Playlist Generator

Spotigo Is an all-in-one solution for discovering and creating playlists based off of BPM.
The core functionality of the site is the playlist generator. It takes in BPM, length, and two genres, and automatically
generates a playlist consisting of songs near the given BPM. 
- This would be a useful tool for quickly creating and sharing workout playlists, tailored to your likes and interests.
- Users can share generated playlists, and the site will curate these playlists and allow users to search through the playlist database.
- Users can log in to have their feed and recommendations personalized.
